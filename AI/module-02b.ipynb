    "## Local Search - Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some key ideas in the Genetic Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there is a problem of some kind that either *is* an optimization problem or the solution can be expressed in terms of an optimization problem.\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to minimize the function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum (x_i - 0.5)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n = 10$.\n",
    "This *is* an optimization problem. Normally, optimization problems are much, much harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Eggholder](http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/egg.png)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The function we wish to optimize is often called the **objective function**.\n",
    "The objective function is closely related to the **fitness** function in the GA.\n",
    "If we have a **maximization** problem, then we can use the objective function directly as a fitness function.\n",
    "If we have a **minimization** problem, then we need to convert the objective function into a suitable fitness function, since fitness functions must always mean \"more is better\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we need to *encode* candidate solutions using an \"alphabet\" analogous to G, A, T, C in DNA.\n",
    "This encoding can be quite abstract.\n",
    "You saw this in the Self Check.\n",
    "There a floating point number was encoded as bits, just as in a computer and a sophisticated decoding scheme was then required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the encoding need not be very complicated at all.\n",
    "For example, in the real-valued GA, discussed in the Lectures, we could represent 2.73 as....2.73.\n",
    "This is similarly true for a string matching problem.\n",
    "We *could* encode \"a\" as \"a\", 97, or '01100001'.\n",
    "And then \"hello\" would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[104, 101, 108, 108, 111]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Genetics terminology, this is the **chromosome** of the individual. And if this individual had the **phenotype** \"h\" for the first character then they would have the **genotype** for \"h\" (either as \"h\", 104, or 01101000).\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it straight, think **geno**type is **genes** and **pheno**type is **phenomenon**, the actual thing that the genes express.\n",
    "So while we might encode a number as 10110110 (genotype), the number itself, 182, is what goes into the fitness function.\n",
    "The environment operates on zebras, not the genes for stripes."

    "## String Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to write a Genetic Algorithm that will solve the problem of matching a target string (at least at the start).\n",
    "Now, this is kind of silly because in order for this to work, you need to know the target string and if you know the target string, why are you trying to do it?\n",
    "Well, the problem is *pedagogical*.\n",
    "It's a fun way of visualizing the GA at work, because as the GA finds better and better candidates, they make more and more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, string matching is not *directly* an optimization problem so this falls under the general category of \"if we convert the problem into an optimization problem we can solve it with an optimization algorithm\" approach to problem solving.\n",
    "This happens all the time.\n",
    "We have a problem.\n",
    "We can't solve it.\n",
    "We convert it to a problem we *can* solve.\n",
    "In this case, we're using the GA to solve the optimization part.\n",
    "\n",
    "And all we need is some sort of measure of the difference between two strings.\n",
    "We can use that measure as a **loss function**.\n",
    "A loss function gives us a score tells us how similar two strings are.\n",
    "The loss function becomes our objective function and we use the GA to minimize it by converting the objective function to a fitness function.\n",
    "So that's the first step, come up with the loss/objective function.\n",
    "The only stipulation is that it must calculate the score based on element to element (character to character) comparisons with no global transformations of the candidate or target strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since this is a GA, we need a **genotype**.\n",
    "The genotype for this problem is a list of \"characters\" (individual letters aren't special in Python like they are in some other languages):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and the **phenotype** is the resulting string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the generic code and problem specific loss function, you'll need to pick parameters for the run.\n",
    "These parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. population size\n",
    "2. number of generations\n",
    "3. probability of crossover\n",
    "4. probability of mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to pick a selection algorithm, either roulette wheel or tournament selection.\n",
    "In the later case, you will need a tournament size.\n",
    "This is all part of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every **ten** (10) generations, you should print out the fitness, genotype, and phenotype of the best individual in the population for the specific generation.\n",
    "The function should return the best individual *of the entire run*, using the same format."
